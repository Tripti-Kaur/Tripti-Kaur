### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a final year Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering student at GITAM University, Visakhapatnam. I have a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, TypeScript, WordPress, React JS, PostgreSQL, C Programming, and Python Programming. I am currently working on building my expertise in web development projects and looking forward to collaborating on interesting purpose-driven projects that can bring an impact on society. I am eager to learn about different technologies and explore various computer science domains.

I have gained valuable industry experience as a Front-End Development intern at Arraign Technologies where I developed my skills in TypeScript, Bootstrap, React JS, and React Hooks. I was able to build a Front-End Netflix Clone Website.

I have also completed various personal projects such as My Portfolio, an Expense Tracker, Shan-E-Punjab Restaurant Website, a Password Manager, and a Rock-Paper-Scissors Game.

I am a Gold level coder on Hackerrank with a specialization in Python. So far, I have earned 1448.33 points on the platform. Additionally, I am a Bronze level coder in Problem Solving on Hackerrank, with 81 points earned so far.

I am also passionate about sketching and painting. I also enjoy playing chess and sudoku. I have been awarded a 25% Merit scholarship in GITAM University in 2019 for gaining a rank of 1653 in the GAT exam and a Golden Art Merit Award for National Level Art competition held by Rangotsav in the year 2016-2017.

I am currently participating in the 6Companies30Days challenge conducted by Arsh Goyal, where he is uploading 15 most important questions in every 5 days which were asked in 6 most big tech companies, to improve my technical skills and increase my chances of getting hired in big tech companies.
